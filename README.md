# Learn the MERN Stack

The source code of this repository is taken from Traversy Media's [Learn the MERN Stack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBTYxXADG_k&list=PLillGF-RfqbbiTGgA77tGO426V3hRF9iE) series.

This is a robust project but I really appriciate the afford that Brad put here. And definitely a MERN stack developer will learn many things from this series.

One little thing to note here, its just my personal opinion is that despite Brad is a great teacher but I think he complicates the code when Redux comes in the spot!

Overall, its really really a great learning resouce for a MERN stack developer but I think its an intermediate level learning material.
